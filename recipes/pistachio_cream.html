    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade pistachio cream is so incredible, you'll be tempted to put is on everything!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups raw unsalted shelled pistachios</li>
        <li>3/4 cup whole milk, or as needed, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons confectioner's sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup white chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, or to taste</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil over medium heat. Add pistachios and boil for just 2 minutes. Drain pistachios, rinse thoroughly with cold water, then drain again.</li>
        <li>Pour pistachios onto a clean kitchen towel. Fold towel in half over pistachios and rub vigorously to remove skins. You may want to repeat this rubbing process with another clean towel; this will help dry pistachios a little more, and make them slightly less slippery to hold onto.</li>
        <li>Carefully pick through pistachios and separate them from their skins; peel off any skins still stuck to pistachio meats. Discard skins, and place peeled pistachio meats into the cup of a high-powered blender.</li>
        <li>In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine 1/4 cup milk, white chocolate chips, and butter. Microwave in 30 second intervals at 50% power (stirring after each 30 second interval), until butter and white chocolate chips are melted and mixture becomes smooth and combined.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1/2 cup milk, powdered sugar, salt, almond extract, and vanilla to the blender cup. Pour in white chocolate mixture.</li>
        <li>Starting on low speed and gradually increasing to high, blend pistachio mixture until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes, stopping often to scrape down the sides of the blender jar. If mixture is too thick, add milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached. Pause blending if mixture is becoming hot; heat may cause it to separate.</li>
        <li>Pour pistachio cream into a glass jar or container, and allow to cool slightly. Pistachio cream is ready to use immediately, or cover and refrigerate. It will keep for 1 to 2 weeks.</li>
        <li>Bon App√©tit</li>
    </ol>
